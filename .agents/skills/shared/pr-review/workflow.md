# PR Review Workflow

1. Classify changes into application, infrastructure, and docs.
2. Verify required checks (lint, unit tests, integration tests) passed.
3. Review contract-sensitive files first (API routes, schemas, manifests).
4. Review stateful and migration paths for rollback safety.
5. Validate observability impact for changed runtime behavior.
6. Publish findings ordered by severity with clear remediation actions.
