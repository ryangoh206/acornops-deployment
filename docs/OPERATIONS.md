# Deployment Operations

## Runtime Ownership

This repository owns operator workflows for:

- local full-stack development
- Docker-on-VM production deployment
- central platform Kubernetes deployment
- workload-cluster agent rollout
- release compatibility metadata

Component repositories own service internals. This repository owns how those components are assembled and exposed.

## Production Domains

Default production DNS zone:

```text
acornops.dev
```

Public production routes:

- `https://console.acornops.dev/`
- `https://docs.acornops.dev/`
- `https://api.acornops.dev/api/v1`
- `https://api.acornops.dev/admin/v1` when the admin API is explicitly enabled
- `wss://api.acornops.dev/api/v1/agent/connect`

Mintlify hosts the public docs at `docs.acornops.dev`; root-domain redirects are owned outside the platform API surface. Execution-engine and llm-gateway stay internal by default.

Platform operators can route provider traffic through API-compatible endpoints
without changing workspace credentials. For VM Compose, set any of
`LLM_PROVIDER_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `LLM_PROVIDER_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, or
`LLM_PROVIDER_GEMINI_BASE_URL`. For Helm, set the corresponding
`components.llmGateway.providerBaseUrls` value. Empty values retain the vendor
SDK defaults. Custom endpoints must implement the native API used by the gateway;
an OpenAI endpoint must support the Responses API, not only Chat Completions.
The `/admin` route is only routed on the API host and must not be proxied from
the management console host.

## VM Production

Prepare:

```bash
cp env/vm/.env.example env/vm/.env.prod
```

Deploy:

```bash
task prod-up
```

Operate:

```bash
task prod-ps
task prod-logs
task prod-down
```

## Kubernetes Production

Validate:

```bash
task k8s-chart-check
task release-matrix-check
```

Run the control-plane HA smoke against a non-production cluster before release promotion:

```bash
ACORNOPS_K8S_HA_SMOKE_CONTEXT=<non-production-context> task k8s-ha-smoke
```

The smoke requires external test Postgres and Redis values or a caller-provided
values file. It creates a deterministic log-target pod by default; set
`ACORNOPS_K8S_HA_SMOKE_LOG_POD_NAMESPACE` and
`ACORNOPS_K8S_HA_SMOKE_LOG_POD_NAME` together to reuse an existing workload pod.
It deliberately does not run as part of `task validate`.

After pushing release tags and publishing artifacts, verify GHCR images and
charts with registry credentials:

```bash
ACORNOPS_CHECK_PUBLISHED_ARTIFACTS=true task release-matrix-check
```

Install:

```bash
helm upgrade --install acornops kubernetes/helm/acornops-platform \
  --namespace acornops \
  --create-namespace \
  --atomic \
  --cleanup-on-fail \
  -f kubernetes/helm/acornops-platform/examples/values-production.yaml
```

Kubernetes deployments require external Postgres and Redis plus a pre-created platform Secret.
NetworkPolicies are enabled by default. Before installing or upgrading, set
`networkPolicies.ingressController.from` for the cluster ingress controller and
allow any private Postgres, Redis, OIDC, Vault, webhook, or MCP destinations in
`networkPolicies.postgres.to`, `networkPolicies.redis.to`, `networkPolicies.vault.to`,
or `networkPolicies.extraEgress.*`.

### Ingress ownership and public access

Treat Ingress ownership and NetworkPolicy authorization as separate choices:

- `exposure.ingress.enabled` controls only whether the platform chart renders
  the public Ingress. Keep it `false` when an operator, GitOps application, or
  another Helm release owns the equivalent Ingress.
- `networkPolicies.ingressController.from` controls which peers can reach the
  management console and control plane. Configure the actual controller peers
  for either ownership model.
- Set `networkPolicies.ingressController.from: []` to render no public
  ingress-controller allow rule. This fails closed while preserving default
  deny and explicit internal component traffic.

Namespace-only selectors allow every pod in the selected namespace. Add a
`podSelector` to the same peer when the namespace is shared, and use multiple
peer items when more than one controller must reach AcornOps. Inspect actual
namespace and pod labels before deployment. The chart does not discover those
labels or install the controller.

NetworkPolicy ports are destination pod ports. The public rules use
`components.managementConsole.service.targetPort` and
`components.controlPlane.service.targetPort`, which default to TCP `8080` and
`8081`; they do not use the Services' externally visible `port` values.

### Verify an Ingress deployment

After installing or upgrading, list the policies and inspect the public
workload policies by their rendered names:

```bash
kubectl -n acornops get networkpolicy

kubectl -n acornops get networkpolicy \
  <management-console-networkpolicy-name> -o yaml

kubectl -n acornops get networkpolicy \
  <control-plane-networkpolicy-name> -o yaml
```

Confirm both policies contain the configured controller peers and their
respective destination `targetPort`. When the peer list is empty, confirm
neither policy contains an empty or broad controller rule and that the
control-plane's internal component rules still exist.

Verify the control-plane Service and endpoints:

```bash
kubectl -n acornops get service \
  <control-plane-service-name> -o yaml

kubectl -n acornops get endpointslice \
  -l kubernetes.io/service-name=<control-plane-service-name> -o wide
```

Then verify the management-console route and both public control-plane routes:

```bash
curl -fsS -o /dev/null https://console.<domain>/
curl -fsS https://console.<domain>/api/v1/auth/config
curl -fsS https://api.<domain>/api/v1/auth/config
```

The API requests should return the same control-plane JSON response without an
ingress timeout. A working console `/` with `504` responses from both `/api`
routes points to the shared control-plane path; inspect its policy, Service,
and EndpointSlice before changing application, hostname, TLS, or OIDC settings.

### Temporary policy for an older chart

If an older chart omits the control-plane allowance when an external Ingress is
used, apply a tightly selected, additive NetworkPolicy until the corrected
chart is deployed. This is a conceptual example; copy the pod and namespace
labels from the live controller and control-plane resources, and use the
configured control-plane `targetPort`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: acornops-control-plane-external-ingress
  namespace: acornops
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/component: control-plane
      app.kubernetes.io/instance: acornops
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: ingress-nginx
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8081
```

Do not disable all NetworkPolicies as a workaround. Kubernetes policies are
additive, so this policy can grant only the missing flow while the chart's
default-deny and component policies remain active.

After upgrading to the corrected chart, inspect the chart-managed
control-plane policy and verify both `/api` routes before removing the temporary
policy:

```bash
kubectl -n acornops delete networkpolicy \
  acornops-control-plane-external-ingress
```

### Roll back

Use Helm history to select the preceding published chart revision, then roll
back and repeat the policy, Service, EndpointSlice, and route checks:

```bash
helm -n acornops history acornops
helm -n acornops rollback acornops <revision> --wait --cleanup-on-fail
```

If the target revision predates ingress-independent policy rendering and the
deployment uses an external Ingress, apply or retain the temporary additive
policy before the rollback. Keep it until a corrected release is deployed and
verified; otherwise the control-plane routes can return to the denied state.

The default Kubernetes and VM deployment policy uses OpenAI with `gpt-5.5` and
allows workspace reasoning summaries, which default to `auto`. Provider API keys
are workspace-owned and configured from AI Settings.

Optional internal service-to-service HTTPS/mTLS is configured under
`internalTransport.tls`. It is disabled by default and uses operator-supplied
Kubernetes Secrets only. Create a CA Secret and one TLS Secret per service, then
set the Secret names under `internalTransport.tls.ca.secretName` and
`internalTransport.tls.certificates.*.secretName`. Keep the public Ingress
backend on the control-plane `http` service port; the chart adds a separate
internal `internal-mtls` port when this feature is enabled. Restart affected pods
after rotating the mounted Secrets.

Password reset is enabled by default for password-backed accounts. Password
self-service signup remains off by default. Configure SMTP delivery first
(`email.deliveryMode=smtp`, `email.from`, `email.smtp.host`, and
`SMTP_USERNAME`/`SMTP_PASSWORD` in the platform Secret) before relying on reset
or enabling signup. Keep `auth.password.emailVerificationRequired=true`;
production startup rejects password reset or signup with required verification
when email delivery is disabled.

### Admin API and workspace plans

The admin API is off by default. Enable it only for reviewed operator
environments, and provide token descriptors through the platform Secret:

```yaml
adminApi:
  enabled: true
  ingress:
    enabled: true
  tokens:
    existingSecretName: acornops-platform-secrets
    tokensJsonKey: CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_TOKENS_JSON
```

`CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_TOKENS_JSON` must contain SHA-256 hash descriptors, not raw
tokens. Rotate raw tokens out of band, update the Secret hash descriptor, and
roll the control-plane pods. The chart renders `CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_API_ENABLED`
from `adminApi.enabled` and loads `CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_TOKENS_JSON` only from a
Secret. Ingress renders `/admin` only under `exposure.ingress.apiHost`.

Workspace plans are configured with `workspacePlans` and rendered to
`WORKSPACE_PLANS_CONFIG_JSON` for the control plane:

```yaml
workspacePlans:
  defaultPlanKey: default
  plans:
    - key: default
      name: Default
      quotas:
        members: 100
        kubernetesClusters: 30
        virtualMachines: 30
```

VM Compose uses the matching `CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_API_ENABLED`,
`CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_TOKENS_JSON`, and `WORKSPACE_PLANS_CONFIG_JSON`
environment variables. Its nginx template also exposes `/admin/` only on
`API_HOST`.

## Migration Operations

Both VM and Kubernetes production paths run database migrations before application startup:

- control-plane SQL migrations
- llm-gateway Alembic migrations

For pre-release deployments, keep external databases disposable or resettable when schema files change.

## Required Validation

Before release or deployment changes:

```bash
task validate
```

When a local full stack is running, run the local-only release smoke:

```bash
task local-smoke
```

The smoke script connects to the local edge proxy at `http://127.0.0.1:8088`
and sends `*.acornops.localhost` Host headers, so it does not rely on production
DNS. It refuses non-local endpoints unless explicitly overridden. Use it after
`task local-up` to verify edge routing, service readiness, same-origin API auth,
seeded workspace/target API paths, VM inventory/issues/metrics/logs, VM MCP
server registration, and a completed read-only VM troubleshooting run with a VM
tool call. It also resets the local `acornops-demo-unhealthy` Deployment to the
seeded bad image, requires the assistant to read and patch the exact Deployment,
approves the pending `patch_resource` call, and verifies a healthy rollout. Set
`ACORNOPS_SMOKE_RUN_REMEDIATION=false` to skip that mutation scenario. It does
not touch production.
