# Agent Handoff

This repository follows the AcornOps vendor-neutral handoff policy.

## Before Handoff

Run `task validate` before handing off deployment changes. Also run targeted
contract, platform, compose, smoke, or stack status checks when the change
touches behavior covered by those checks.

## Required Evidence

Every handoff must include:

- exact commands run
- pass or fail result for each command
- skipped checks and why they were skipped
- docs changed, or `Docs impact: none` with the reason
- residual risks or follow-up work
- commit hash, branch, or pull request link when applicable

## Commit Message Guidance

Use Conventional Commits 1.0.0 for commits and pull request titles:

```text
type(scope): summary
```

Recommended default types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`,
`chore`, `ci`, `build`, `perf`, `style`, and `revert`.

Use `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for breaking changes.

Repository teams may document additional types when needed. Existing historical
commits are not rewritten, but new commits and pull request titles must follow
this convention.
This guidance is a repository handoff standard, not a GitHub CI gate.

## Vendor Neutrality

`AGENTS.md` is the repository-tracked agent entrypoint. Do not add required
vendor-specific instruction files such as `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules`, or
`GEMINI.md` as part of this repository's harness.
