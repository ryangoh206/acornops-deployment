# Deployment Contracts

This repository owns deployment and compatibility contracts rather than service API schemas.

## Contract Surfaces

- Compose service names and profile membership
- Edge proxy public routes
- Mintlify public docs host (`docs.acornops.dev`)
- Admin API enablement, token Secret wiring, and API-host-only `/admin` routing
- Workspace plan and quota config rendered into control-plane runtime env
- AI provider/model and reasoning summary policy rendered into control-plane runtime env
- Deployment-owned workflow execution and report-retention policy rendered into control-plane runtime env
- Deployment-track environment templates
- External integration account-link token wiring for VM Compose and Helm
- Helm Ingress ownership and NetworkPolicy peer authorization for public workloads
- Helm global and per-component `trust.additionalCaBundle` references for
  additive private CA trust
- Helm `internalTransport.tls` values for optional operator-supplied internal HTTPS/mTLS
- Password email verification/reset and SMTP environment wiring
- Release image compatibility metadata
- agentk rollout env expectations for Kubernetes cluster installs
- Universal starter automation provisioning is owned by control plane and is independent of optional development target fixtures
- MCP registry bootstrap and workspace-management policy, with no public registry enabled by default

## Internal Transport TLS

Kubernetes platform deployments use HTTP for service-to-service calls by default.
When operators set `internalTransport.tls.enabled=true`, the chart mounts an
operator-supplied CA Secret and per-service TLS Secrets into control-plane,
execution-engine, and llm-gateway pods. The chart only accepts Secret names and
Secret key names; it does not render raw certificate or private key material.

Application-layer credentials remain required in both modes:
`EXECUTION_ENGINE_DISPATCH_TOKEN`, `ORCH_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `LLM_GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN`,
and run-scoped JWTs are still enforced. The control-plane public HTTP listener
continues to serve Ingress traffic, while internal callbacks, JWKS, and the
built-in MCP bridge use the separate internal HTTPS listener when TLS is enabled.

## Ingress Ownership And NetworkPolicy Peers

Helm Ingress ownership and packet authorization are independent contracts.
`exposure.ingress.enabled` controls only whether the chart renders the Ingress
resource. It must not change Services, Deployments, or NetworkPolicy source
allowances. `networkPolicies.enabled` controls whether the chart renders its
default-deny and explicit allow policies.

When NetworkPolicies are enabled, `networkPolicies.ingressController.from`
controls whether and from where ingress-controller traffic may reach the
management console and control plane, regardless of whether the chart or an
external system owns the Ingress. A non-empty list renders exactly the
configured Kubernetes NetworkPolicy peers for both public workloads. An empty
list omits each ingress-controller allow rule entirely and therefore fails
closed without weakening default deny or removing internal component rules.
These rules use each workload's configured `service.targetPort`; the chart does
not discover ingress-controller labels or infer authorization from Ingress
ownership.

## Additional CA Trust

The global Helm values contract is one of these two mutually exclusive,
namespace-local references:

- `global.trust.additionalCaBundle.configMapKeyRef.name` and `.key`
- `global.trust.additionalCaBundle.secretKeyRef.name` and `.key`

The same shape under `components.controlPlane`, `components.executionEngine`,
or `components.llmGateway` overrides the global bundle for that component.

Runtime wiring uses `ADDITIONAL_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` for Python, adds
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` for Node.js, selects the VM Compose overlay with
`ADDITIONAL_CA_BUNDLE_SOURCE_PATH`, and uses
`ACORNOPS_AGENT_ADDITIONAL_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` for target-agent install paths.

Both references default to `null`; a selected reference requires both of its
fields. The chart accepts no inline PEM, private key, client certificate, custom
mount path, or TLS-verification bypass. It maps the selected key from an
existing resource in the Helm release namespace to the read-only
`additional-ca` volume at `/etc/acornops/trust/additional-ca.pem` and sets
`ADDITIONAL_CA_BUNDLE_FILE`; Node.js workloads also receive
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. The source is not optional, so a missing resource or key
fails pod startup. Runtime clients add this file to public CA trust rather than
replacing that trust.

This CA-only contract is independent of `internalTransport.tls`, which
owns AcornOps service-to-service HTTPS/mTLS trust and identity material. It also
does not grant NetworkPolicy egress to a private issuer. Operators must
distribute the resource into the AcornOps namespace, configure the dedicated
`networkPolicies.oidc` or `networkPolicies.webhooks` rule (or the applicable
component egress rule for other dependencies), and restart affected pods
after trust-bundle changes. Rotation uses an old/new CA overlap followed by a
restart at each bundle transition because Node.js reads `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`
only at process startup.

## Admin API And Workspace Plans

The deployment contract for the control-plane admin API is:

- Helm value `adminApi.enabled` renders `CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_API_ENABLED`.
- Helm loads `CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_TOKENS_JSON` from an existing Kubernetes
  Secret key; the chart does not render raw admin tokens into ConfigMaps.
- Helm ingress adds `/admin` only for `exposure.ingress.apiHost`.
- VM Compose passes `CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_API_ENABLED` and
  `CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_TOKENS_JSON` to the control plane from the env file.
- VM nginx routes `/admin/` only for `API_HOST`.

Admin token JSON values are SHA-256 hash descriptors. Raw admin tokens are
operator-held secrets and must not appear in values files, ConfigMaps, logs, or
docs examples.

Workspace plans are configured by Helm `workspacePlans` or VM
`WORKSPACE_PLANS_CONFIG_JSON` and rendered into the control plane as
`WORKSPACE_PLANS_CONFIG_JSON`. The default plan includes member, Kubernetes
cluster, and virtual machine quotas; admin quota overrides are persisted by the
control plane per workspace.

Workspace audit log lifecycle is configured by Helm `auditLogging`. The chart
renders `auditLogging.mode` to `WORKSPACE_AUDIT_LOGGING_MODE`; supported values
are `read_write`, `write_only`, and `disabled`, with `read_write` as the
default. The chart renders `auditLogging.retentionDays` to
`WORKSPACE_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`; it must be a positive integer and defaults to
`365`.

AI provider/model policy is configured by Helm `ai.allowedProviders` and
`ai.allowedProviderModels` or the matching Compose environment variables.
Provider-scoped models use the control-plane-native
`provider:model|model;provider:model` serialization. The chart renders them to
`LLM_ALLOWED_PROVIDERS` and `LLM_ALLOWED_PROVIDER_MODELS`. The chart renders
reasoning summary policy to
`LLM_REASONING_SUMMARIES_ENABLED`,
`LLM_ALLOWED_REASONING_SUMMARY_MODES`, and
`LLM_ALLOWED_REASONING_EFFORTS`. These values are a deployment ceiling only;
new workspaces default to `auto` when summaries are enabled and allowed, and
workspace admins can tune or disable summaries through AI Settings.

## MCP Registry Bootstrap

`components.llmGateway.catalog` and the matching Compose variables configure optional deployment-managed MCP registries. The Official MCP Registry is opt-in. Bootstrap registries use HTTPS roots or path prefixes without `/v0.1`, URL credentials, query parameters, or fragments; only direct routing is supported.

The gateway reconciles bootstrap sources by display name. Changed entries are updated and synchronized, while removed or disabled entries become disabled instead of being deleted. Registry credentials stay in referenced Secrets or environment-backed secret inputs and must never appear in rendered ConfigMaps, API responses, or logs. Registry availability remains outside platform readiness.

## External integration account linking

The deployment contract for external integration account linking is:

- VM Compose passes `EXTERNAL_INTEGRATION_CLIENTS_JSON` to the control plane from
  the env file.
- Helm loads `EXTERNAL_INTEGRATION_CLIENTS_JSON` from the existing platform Secret
  through `secrets.keys.controlPlane.externalIntegrationClientsJson`.
- The JSON contains installed integration client descriptors with SHA-256 token
  hashes only. Raw bearer tokens are generated and distributed out of band, are
  never committed, and only authorize the external integration link, resolve,
  revoke, and linked-user bot endpoints.

## Validation

- `task contracts:check` validates this repository's deployment manifest and, when sibling repos are present, cross-repo contract manifests.
- `task platform-contracts` runs the same cross-repo comparison explicitly.
- Service API contracts remain in the service repositories and are mirrored through their `docs/contracts/manifest.json` files.
